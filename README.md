## üìÅ Project Structure (Key Components)

* `src/App.js`: The main application component, setting up the global theme, header (logo, unit selection), search bar, and rendering the primary `Home` component.
* `src/Home.js`: The central component responsible for displaying current weather details and orchestrating the `DailyForcast` and `HourlyForcast` components.
* `src/components/DailyForcast.js`: Renders the 7-day weather forecast using Material-UI cards.
* `src/components/HourlyForcast.js`: Displays hourly weather predictions for a selected day, complete with a day selection dropdown.
* `src/main.jsx`: The application's entry point, responsible for rendering the React app, enabling `StrictMode`, and integrating the Redux store.
* `src/store.js`: (Inferred) Where the Redux store is configured and reducers are combined.
* `src/contexts/WeatherDataContext.js`: (Inferred) Provides weather data to consuming components via React Context.
* `src/components/weatherIcons.js`: (Inferred) A mapping of weather codes to visual icons.
